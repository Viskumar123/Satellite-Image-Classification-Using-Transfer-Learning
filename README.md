# Satellite-Image-Classification-Using-Transfer-Learning
Built a model which can identifying four different categories (Desert, Water, Cloudy and Green Area) of images. Leveraging the power of transfer learning, the model utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-50 architecture to achieve high accuracy with minimal training data.
